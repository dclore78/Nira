# Ollama Binary Fetching

To complete the build, you need to download the Ollama binary:

1. Go to https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases
2. Download the Windows binary (ollama-windows-amd64.exe) 
3. Rename it to ollama.exe
4. Place it in this bin/ directory

Alternatively, if you have ollama installed system-wide, 
the app will try to find it automatically.

The binary should be placed at: /home/runner/work/Nira/Nira/electron/bin/ollama.exe
